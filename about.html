			<p>
				Born into the prestigious GOJO family, Satoru inherited the immensely powerful Limitless technique and the Six Eyes, making him one of the most formidable sorcerers in history. Despite his laid-back and carefree attitude, GOJO is deeply committed to protecting humanity from curses and nurturing the next generation of sorcerers.
			</p>
			<b>Abilities</b>
			<b>Limitless
			<p>
				GOJO's inherited technique, Limitless, grants him absolute control over space at an atomic level. This technique has several advanced applications:</b>
Infinity: Creates an infinite barrier between GOJO and his opponents, making it impossible to touch him.
Blue: A powerful attraction force that draws objects and people towards a single point.
Red: An immense repulsion force that blasts objects and people away.
Hollow Purple: A devastating attack that combines both the attraction and repulsion forces, erasing anything in its path.
			</p>
			<b>Six Eyes</b>
			<p>
				The Six Eyes is a rare ocular jujutsu technique unique to the GOJO family. It grants GOJO enhanced perception, allowing him to see cursed energy with incredible clarity. This ability also reduces the energy consumption of his techniques to almost nothing, enabling him to use powerful jujutsu techniques without tiring.
			</p>
			<b>Domain Expansion: Unlimited Void</b>
			<p>
				GOJO's Domain Expansion creates a space filled with infinite information, overwhelming his opponents' senses and rendering them immobile. Inside this domain, GOJO has absolute control and can easily defeat his enemies.
